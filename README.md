# Simple Calculator in C++

This is a basic command-line calculator built using **C++**. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus using a **switch-case** statement and a **do-while loop**.

---

## 🧮 Features

- Perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Input validation for division/modulo by zero
- Looping functionality to continue operations without restarting the program
- User-friendly input prompts

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter the first number.
2. Then, the user chooses an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
3. User inputs the second number.
4. The program performs the selected operation and prints the result.
5. User is asked if they want to perform another operation.
6. If yes (`y` or `Y`), the loop repeats. If no, the program exits.

## 👨‍💻 Sample Output

enter first no.:

10

enter operator + - * / % :

'+'

enter second no.:

20

your sum is :30

do you want to perform another operation type y for yes and n for no
